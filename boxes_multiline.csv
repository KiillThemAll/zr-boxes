"\n%$$%Agricola Revised Edition game box insert, including some expansions.\n",
"\n%$$%This insert was designed with 3 mm plywood in mind, and should work fine %$$%with\n%$$%materials around this thickness.\n%$$%\n%$$%This is an insert for the [Agricola Revised Edition](https://%$$%boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/200680/agricola-revised-edition)\n%$$%board game. It is specifically designed around the [Farmers Of The Moor %$$%expansion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/257344/agricola-%$$%farmers-moor),\n%$$%and should also store the [5-6 players expansion](https://boardgamegeek.com/%$$%boardgameexpansion/210625/agricola-expansion-5-and-6-players)\n%$$%(not tested, but I tried to take everything into account for it, please %$$%inform\n%$$%us if you tested it).\n%$$%\n%$$%It can be stored inside the original game box, including the 2 expansions,\n%$$%with the lid slightly raised.\n%$$%\n%$$%The parts of a given element are mostly generated next to each other %$$%vertically.\n%$$%It should be straightforward to match them.\n%$$%\n%$$%Here are the different elements, from left to right in the generated file.\n%$$%\n%$$%#### Card tray\n%$$%\n%$$%The cards are all kept in a tray, with paper dividers to sort them easily. %$$%When\n%$$%the tray is not full of cards, wood dividers slides in slots in order to %$$%keep\n%$$%the cards from falling into the empty space.\n%$$%\n%$$%There should be enough space for the main game, Farmers Of The Moor, and the %$$%5-6\n%$$%player expansion, but not much more than that.\n%$$%\n%$$%To keep a lower profile, the cards are at a slight angle, and the paper %$$%dividers\n%$$%tabs are horizontal instead of vertical.\n%$$%A small wall keeps the card against one side while the tabs protrude on the\n%$$%other side, above the small wall.\n%$$%\n%$$%The wall with the big hole is the sloped one. It goes between the two\n%$$%\""comb-like\"" walls first, with its two small holes at the bottom. Then %$$%there is a\n%$$%low-height long wall with a sloped edge which should go from the sloped wall %$$%to\n%$$%the other side. You can finish the tray with the last wall at the end.\n%$$%\n%$$%#### Upper level trays\n%$$%\n%$$%4 trays with movable walls are used to store resources. They were designed %$$%to\n%$$%store them in this order:\n%$$%\n%$$%* Stone / Vegetable / Pig / Cow\n%$$%* Reed / Grain / Sheep\n%$$%* Wood / Clay\n%$$%* Food / Fire\n%$$%\n%$$%The wall would probably be better if fixed instead of movable, but I would %$$%like\n%$$%to test with the 5-6 player expansion to be sure their positions are %$$%correct\n%$$%with it too.\n%$$%\n%$$%The little feet of the movable wall should be glued. The triangles are put\n%$$%horizontally, with their bases towards the sides.\n%$$%\n%$$%#### Lower level tray\n%$$%\n%$$%The lower level tray is used to store the horses.\n%$$%\n%$$%#### Room/Field tiles\n%$$%\n%$$%Two boxes are generated to store the room/field tiles. One for the wood/%$$%field,\n%$$%the other for the clay/stone. They are stored with the main opening upside, %$$%but\n%$$%I prefer to use them during play with this face on the side.\n%$$%\n%$$%#### Moor/Forest and miscellaneous tiles\n%$$%\n%$$%A box is generated to store the Moor/Forest tiles, and some other tiles such %$$%as\n%$$%the \""multiple resources\"" cardboard tokens.\n%$$%\n%$$%The Moor/Forest tiles are at the same height as the Room/Field, and the %$$%upper\n%$$%level trays are directly on them. The horse box and player box are slightly\n%$$%lower. This Moor/Forest box have a lowered corner (the one for the %$$%miscellaneous\n%$$%tiles). Two cardboard pieces can be stored between the smaller boxes and %$$%the\n%$$%upper level trays (as seen on the picture).\n%$$%\n%$$%Be sure to match the pieces so that the walls with smaller heights are next %$$%to\n%$$%each other.\n%$$%\n%$$%#### Players bit boxes\n%$$%\n%$$%Each player has its own box where the bits of his color are stored.\n%$$%The cardboard bed from Farmers Of The Moor is central to this box.\n%$$%\n%$$%* The fences are stored inside the bed\n%$$%* The bed is placed in the box, with holes to keep it there (and to take %$$%less\n%$$%  height)\n%$$%* The stables are stored in the two corners\n%$$%* The five farmers are stored between the bed and the three walls, %$$%alternatively\n%$$%  head up and head down.\n%$$%\n%$$%During assembly, the small bars are put in the middle holes. The two bigger\n%$$%holes at the ends are used for the bed feet. The bar keeps the bed from\n%$$%protruding underneath.\n%$$%\n",

\n%$$%This box is designed as a housing for electronic projects. It has hatches %$$%that can be re-opened with simple tools. It intentionally cannot be opened %$$%with bare hands - if build with thin enough material.\n%$$%\n%$$%#### Caution\n%$$%There is a chance that the latches of the back wall or the back wall itself %$$%interfere with the front panel or its mounting frame/lips. The generator %$$%does not check for this. So depending on the variant chosen you might need %$$%to make the box deeper (increase y parameter) or the panel angle steeper %$$%(increase angle parameter) until there is enough room.\n%$$%\n%$$%It's also possible that the frame of the panel interferes with the floor if %$$%the hi parameter is too small.\n%$$%\n%$$%#### Assembly instructions\n%$$%The main body is easy to assemble by starting with the floor and then adding %$$%the four walls and (if present) the top piece.\n%$$%\n%$$%If the back wall is removable you need to add the lips and latches. The U-%$$%shaped clamps holding the latches in place need to be clued in place without %$$%also gluing the latches themselves. Make sure the springs on the latches %$$%point inwards and the angled ends point to the side walls as shown here:\n%$$%\n%$$%![Back wall details](static/samples/Console2-backwall-detail.jpg)\n%$$%\n%$$%If the panel is removable you need to add the springs with the tabs to the %$$%side lips. This photo shows the variant which has the panel glued to the %$$%frame:\n%$$%\n%$$%![Back wall details](static/samples/Console2-panel-detail.jpg)\n%$$%\n%$$%If space is tight you may consider not gluing the cross pieces in place and %$$%remove them after the glue-up. This may prevent the latches of the back wall %$$%and the panel from interfering with each other.\n%$$%\n%$$%The variant using finger joints only has the two side lips without the cross %$$%bars.\n%$$%\n%$$%#### Re-Opening\n%$$%\n%$$%The latches at the back wall lock in place when closed. To open them they %$$%need to be pressed in and can then be moved aside.\n%$$%\n%$$%To remove the panel you have to press in the four tabs at the side. It is %$$%easiest to push them in and then pull the panel up a little bit so the tabs %$$%stay in.\n,

"\n%$$%### Description\n%$$%Fat balls are quite common to feed tits. Here you can build a dispenser that %$$%protects\n%$$%the fat balls from rain and snow. The design was tested using 4mm plywood %$$%for the\n%$$%main structural parts. For the spacer of the locking mechanism two layers of %$$%3mm\n%$$%plywood have been stacked. The poles were made from 8mm diameter beech rod %$$%and 19cm\n%$$%in length. Some basic consistency checks have been made for different %$$%numbers, but\n%$$%only the defaults have ever been built.\n%$$%\n%$$%The final dispenser consists of two parts which slide into each other. You %$$%can mount\n%$$%a hook to hang it into a tree. All edges that have angles different from 90 %$$%degrees (chamfers)\n%$$%have engraved guiding lines which indicate the angle. You have to sand the %$$%edge such\n%$$%that the pieces fit together.\n%$$%\n%$$%The top part (roof) consists of the the following elements for a N sided %$$%dispenser:\n%$$%\n%$$%  * The N sided roof bottom plate which supports the roof tiles. It has a %$$%central cut out\n%$$%    which is needed for assembly and on the bottom side an engraved line %$$%which indicates the\n%$$%    position of the mounting bracket.\n%$$%  * N triangles forming the roof. They also have a small arc at the tip %$$%(roof_hole_diameter)\n%$$%  which acts as a drilling guide if you want to mount a hook.\n%$$%  * The N sided roof support piece which has a central hole for the hook. It %$$%is been mounted\n%$$%  to the roof tiles through the hole in the roof bottom plate to support the %$$%roof\n%$$%  tiles and acts as a mounting plate for the hook.\n%$$%  * Spacer(s); in the reference builds 2 spacers using 3mm plywood have been %$$%used. The spacer\n%$$%  needs to be a bit thicker than the ceiling (see below). That's the %$$%smaller\n%$$%  \""U\"" shaped part which is glued to the bottom side of the roof bottom %$$%plate.\n%$$%  * The bracket is also \""U\"" shaped and a bit wider than the spacer. This %$$%is glued to the\n%$$%  bottom of the spacer and holds the cage (bottom part).\n%$$%\n%$$%The bottom part (cage) consists of the follwoing elements:\n%$$%\n%$$%  * The ceiling is N sided with the central refill hole and N smaller holes %$$%into which\n%$$%  the poles are fitted.\n%$$%  * The N sided floor part with finger joints for the balcony walls and %$$%holes for\n%$$%  the poles. A central hole to drain rain water can be added as well.\n%$$%  * N balcony walls surrounding the floor.\n%$$%  * N poles that join floor and ceiling (not part of the drawing)\n%$$%\n%$$%Other parts needed for assembly:\n%$$%\n%$$%  * Wooden rod (N times the length of the poles).\n%$$%  * A hook (e.g. M5x50mm)\n%$$%  * A washer to distribute the load of the hook to the support piece\n%$$%  * One or two nuts to secure the hook\n%$$%  * Optional, a pice of wire mesh\n%$$%\n%$$%Assembly:\n%$$%\n%$$%  * Sand all chamfers\n%$$%  * Glue balcony walls to the floor\n%$$%  * Glue pairs of roof tiles and use the roof bottom plate as a jig, Hot %$$%glue may be used to\n%$$%    tack the parts.\n%$$%  * Glue all roof tiles to form the roof\n%$$%  * Glue spacer(s) and the bracket into a stack\n%$$%  * Glue roof tiles to the roof bottom plate and attach the support piece\n%$$%  * Glue the stack to the roof bottom plate\n%$$%  * Cut the poles to length\n%$$%  * If you want to use multiple colors paint now, otherwise you also can %$$%paint later\n%$$%  * After painting you may need to get the paint out of the pole holes again %$$%using a drillbit\n%$$%  * Glue the poles into floor plate and ceiling\n%$$%  * Attach the hanger\n%$$%  * Attach the wire mesh\n%$$%    ",

Create pieces larger than your laser cutter by joining them with Dove Tails,
This can be used to just create a big panel in a smaller laser cutter. But %$$%the actual use is to split large parts into multiple smaller pieces. Copy %$$%the outline onto the sheet and then use the pieces to cut it into multiple %$$%parts that each can fit your laser cutter. Note that each piece must be cut %$$%with the sheet surrounding it to ensure the burn correction (aka kerf) is %$$%correct. Depending on your vector graphics software you may need to %$$%duplicate your part multiple times and then generate the intersection %$$%between one copy and each rectangular part.\n%$$%\n%$$%The Boxes.py drawings assume that the laser is cutting in the center of the %$$%line and the width of the line represents the material that is cut away. %$$%Make sure your changes work the same way and you do not cutting away the %$$%kerf.\n%$$%\n%$$%Small dove tails make it easier to fit parts in without problems. Lookout %$$%for pieces cut loose where the dove tails meet the edge of the parts. Move %$$%your part if necessary to avoid dove tails or details of your part colliding %$$%in a weird way.\n%$$%\n%$$%For plywood this method works well with a very stiff press fit.
