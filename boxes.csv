AgricolaInsert,
"\nAgricola Revised Edition game box insert, including some expansions.\n",
"\nThis insert was designed with 3 mm plywood in mind, and should work fine with\nmaterials around this thickness.\n\nThis is an insert for the [Agricola Revised Edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/200680/agricola-revised-edition)\nboard game. It is specifically designed around the [Farmers Of The Moor expansion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/257344/agricola-farmers-moor),\nand should also store the [5-6 players expansion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/210625/agricola-expansion-5-and-6-players)\n(not tested, but I tried to take everything into account for it, please inform\nus if you tested it).\n\nIt can be stored inside the original game box, including the 2 expansions,\nwith the lid slightly raised.\n\nThe parts of a given element are mostly generated next to each other vertically.\nIt should be straightforward to match them.\n\nHere are the different elements, from left to right in the generated file.\n\n#### Card tray\n\nThe cards are all kept in a tray, with paper dividers to sort them easily. When\nthe tray is not full of cards, wood dividers slides in slots in order to keep\nthe cards from falling into the empty space.\n\nThere should be enough space for the main game, Farmers Of The Moor, and the 5-6\nplayer expansion, but not much more than that.\n\nTo keep a lower profile, the cards are at a slight angle, and the paper dividers\ntabs are horizontal instead of vertical.\nA small wall keeps the card against one side while the tabs protrude on the\nother side, above the small wall.\n\nThe wall with the big hole is the sloped one. It goes between the two\n\""comb-like\"" walls first, with its two small holes at the bottom. Then there is a\nlow-height long wall with a sloped edge which should go from the sloped wall to\nthe other side. You can finish the tray with the last wall at the end.\n\n#### Upper level trays\n\n4 trays with movable walls are used to store resources. They were designed to\nstore them in this order:\n\n* Stone / Vegetable / Pig / Cow\n* Reed / Grain / Sheep\n* Wood / Clay\n* Food / Fire\n\nThe wall would probably be better if fixed instead of movable, but I would like\nto test with the 5-6 player expansion to be sure their positions are correct\nwith it too.\n\nThe little feet of the movable wall should be glued. The triangles are put\nhorizontally, with their bases towards the sides.\n\n#### Lower level tray\n\nThe lower level tray is used to store the horses.\n\n#### Room/Field tiles\n\nTwo boxes are generated to store the room/field tiles. One for the wood/field,\nthe other for the clay/stone. They are stored with the main opening upside, but\nI prefer to use them during play with this face on the side.\n\n#### Moor/Forest and miscellaneous tiles\n\nA box is generated to store the Moor/Forest tiles, and some other tiles such as\nthe \""multiple resources\"" cardboard tokens.\n\nThe Moor/Forest tiles are at the same height as the Room/Field, and the upper\nlevel trays are directly on them. The horse box and player box are slightly\nlower. This Moor/Forest box have a lowered corner (the one for the miscellaneous\ntiles). Two cardboard pieces can be stored between the smaller boxes and the\nupper level trays (as seen on the picture).\n\nBe sure to match the pieces so that the walls with smaller heights are next to\neach other.\n\n#### Players bit boxes\n\nEach player has its own box where the bits of his color are stored.\nThe cardboard bed from Farmers Of The Moor is central to this box.\n\n* The fences are stored inside the bed\n* The bed is placed in the box, with holes to keep it there (and to take less\n  height)\n* The stables are stored in the two corners\n* The five farmers are stored between the bed and the three walls, alternatively\n  head up and head down.\n\nDuring assembly, the small bars are put in the middle holes. The two bigger\nholes at the ends are used for the bed feet. The bar keeps the bed from\nprotruding underneath.\n\n",

This generator will make shapes that you can use to select\noptimal value for burn parameter for other generators. After burning try to\nattach sides with the same value and use best fitting one on real projects.\nIn this generator set burn in the Default Settings to the lowest value\nto be tested. To get an idea cut a rectangle with known nominal size and\nmeasure the shrinkage due to the width of the laser cut. Now you can\nmeasure the burn value that you should use in other generators. It is half\nthe difference of the overall size as shrinkage is occurring on both\nsides. You can use the reference rectangle as it is rendered without burn\ncorrection.\n\nSee also LBeam that can serve as compact BurnTest and FlexTest for testing flex settings.\n,

The filter does not include the top rim. You need some rectangular wooden strip about 2-3cm in size to glue around. The x and y are without this rim and should be about 5 cm smaller that the nominal size.\n\nThe following sizes are currently hard coded:\n\n* Height of rails on top: 50mm\n* Borders on top: 40mm\n* Char coal width (horizontal): 40mm\n* Bottom width: 40 + 20 + 40 mm\n\nFor assembly it is important that all bottom plates are the same way up. This allows the ribs of adjacent pockets to pass beside each other.\n\nThere are three type of ribs:\n\n* Those with staight tops go in the middle of the bottom plates\n* Those pointier angle go at the outer sides and meet with the side bars\n* The less pointy go at all other sides of the bottom plates that will end up on the inside\n\nThe last two types of ribs do not have finger joints on the outside but still need to be glued to the top beam of the adjacent pocket or the left or right side bar.\n,

\nThis box is designed as a housing for electronic projects. It has hatches that can be re-opened with simple tools. It intentionally cannot be opened with bare hands - if build with thin enough material.\n\n#### Caution\nThere is a chance that the latches of the back wall or the back wall itself interfere with the front panel or its mounting frame/lips. The generator does not check for this. So depending on the variant chosen you might need to make the box deeper (increase y parameter) or the panel angle steeper (increase angle parameter) until there is enough room.\n\nIt's also possible that the frame of the panel interferes with the floor if the hi parameter is too small.\n\n#### Assembly instructions\nThe main body is easy to assemble by starting with the floor and then adding the four walls and (if present) the top piece.\n\nIf the back wall is removable you need to add the lips and latches. The U-shaped clamps holding the latches in place need to be clued in place without also gluing the latches themselves. Make sure the springs on the latches point inwards and the angled ends point to the side walls as shown here:\n\n![Back wall details](static/samples/Console2-backwall-detail.jpg)\n\nIf the panel is removable you need to add the springs with the tabs to the side lips. This photo shows the variant which has the panel glued to the frame:\n\n![Back wall details](static/samples/Console2-panel-detail.jpg)\n\nIf space is tight you may consider not gluing the cross pieces in place and remove them after the glue-up. This may prevent the latches of the back wall and the panel from interfering with each other.\n\nThe variant using finger joints only has the two side lips without the cross bars.\n\n#### Re-Opening\n\nThe latches at the back wall lock in place when closed. To open them they need to be pressed in and can then be moved aside.\n\nTo remove the panel you have to press in the four tabs at the side. It is easiest to push them in and then pull the panel up a little bit so the tabs stay in.\n,

FatBallDispenser,
Birdhouse for fat balls.,
"\n### Description\nFat balls are quite common to feed tits. Here you can build a dispenser that protects\nthe fat balls from rain and snow. The design was tested using 4mm plywood for the\nmain structural parts. For the spacer of the locking mechanism two layers of 3mm\nplywood have been stacked. The poles were made from 8mm diameter beech rod and 19cm\nin length. Some basic consistency checks have been made for different numbers, but\nonly the defaults have ever been built.\n\nThe final dispenser consists of two parts which slide into each other. You can mount\na hook to hang it into a tree. All edges that have angles different from 90 degrees (chamfers)\nhave engraved guiding lines which indicate the angle. You have to sand the edge such\nthat the pieces fit together.\n\nThe top part (roof) consists of the the following elements for a N sided dispenser:\n\n  * The N sided roof bottom plate which supports the roof tiles. It has a central cut out\n    which is needed for assembly and on the bottom side an engraved line which indicates the\n    position of the mounting bracket.\n  * N triangles forming the roof. They also have a small arc at the tip (roof_hole_diameter)\n  which acts as a drilling guide if you want to mount a hook.\n  * The N sided roof support piece which has a central hole for the hook. It is been mounted\n  to the roof tiles through the hole in the roof bottom plate to support the roof\n  tiles and acts as a mounting plate for the hook.\n  * Spacer(s); in the reference builds 2 spacers using 3mm plywood have been used. The spacer\n  needs to be a bit thicker than the ceiling (see below). That's the smaller\n  \""U\"" shaped part which is glued to the bottom side of the roof bottom plate.\n  * The bracket is also \""U\"" shaped and a bit wider than the spacer. This is glued to the\n  bottom of the spacer and holds the cage (bottom part).\n\nThe bottom part (cage) consists of the follwoing elements:\n\n  * The ceiling is N sided with the central refill hole and N smaller holes into which\n  the poles are fitted.\n  * The N sided floor part with finger joints for the balcony walls and holes for\n  the poles. A central hole to drain rain water can be added as well.\n  * N balcony walls surrounding the floor.\n  * N poles that join floor and ceiling (not part of the drawing)\n\nOther parts needed for assembly:\n\n  * Wooden rod (N times the length of the poles).\n  * A hook (e.g. M5x50mm)\n  * A washer to distribute the load of the hook to the support piece\n  * One or two nuts to secure the hook\n  * Optional, a pice of wire mesh\n\nAssembly:\n\n  * Sand all chamfers\n  * Glue balcony walls to the floor\n  * Glue pairs of roof tiles and use the roof bottom plate as a jig, Hot glue may be used to\n    tack the parts.\n  * Glue all roof tiles to form the roof\n  * Glue spacer(s) and the bracket into a stack\n  * Glue roof tiles to the roof bottom plate and attach the support piece\n  * Glue the stack to the roof bottom plate\n  * Cut the poles to length\n  * If you want to use multiple colors paint now, otherwise you also can paint later\n  * After painting you may need to get the paint out of the pole holes again using a drillbit\n  * Glue the poles into floor plate and ceiling\n  * Attach the hanger\n  * Attach the wire mesh\n    ",

JointPanel,
Create pieces larger than your laser cutter by joining them with Dove Tails,
This can be used to just create a big panel in a smaller laser cutter. But the actual use is to split large parts into multiple smaller pieces. Copy the outline onto the sheet and then use the pieces to cut it into multiple parts that each can fit your laser cutter. Note that each piece must be cut with the sheet surrounding it to ensure the burn correction (aka kerf) is correct. Depending on your vector graphics software you may need to duplicate your part multiple times and then generate the intersection between one copy and each rectangular part.\n\nThe Boxes.py drawings assume that the laser is cutting in the center of the line and the width of the line represents the material that is cut away. Make sure your changes work the same way and you do not cutting away the kerf.\n\nSmall dove tails make it easier to fit parts in without problems. Lookout for pieces cut loose where the dove tails meet the edge of the parts. Move your part if necessary to avoid dove tails or details of your part colliding in a weird way.\n\nFor plywood this method works well with a very stiff press fit. Aim for needing a hammer to join the pieces together. This way they will feel like they have been welder together.\n\n,

Kamishibai,
Kamishibai butai (japanese image theatre),
"\n    This is a kamishibai butai (japanese image theatre), with several options for covering the different\n    holes when put away.\n    Magenta cuts should be performed before the blue cuts.\n    The recommended wood thickness is 5 mm at least, particularly if you go for big sizes (which works\n    fine with A4 or A3). If you use 3 mm, you should not use the screwing option (disabled by default),\n    so you can assemble your box with glue or force the pieces together (using a bigger burn parameter).\n    Please note that using the screwing option often means adding feet (which can be 3D printed for\n    example). It makes the box easier to mount and unmount for repairing purposes, and the feet protect\n    the wood from whatever surface the box is put on. Screws are not compatible with a small frame\n    thickness (i.e. with sheets with a small margin).\n    For assembling the box, please follow the following steps:\n    1. Assemble the front side and back side pieces to the front and back of the front and back panels\n    respectively\n    2. Assemble the top handle pieces together and insert two of the plates into the two holes (centered);\n    then insert the assembled handles into the dansle ceiling and add the two other plates\n    3. Insert the front and back panels into the bottom panel\n    4. Attach the handle between the top of the front and back panels, then add the top panel but do not\n    fasten it yet, just keep it loose on top\n    5. Assemble the locks together to the doors if enabled:\n       5.1 lock with key : lock front - lock external - plate cut from the door (also add the door now) -\n       lock internal\n       5.2 lock simple : lock grip - lock external - plate cut from the door (also add the door now) -\n       lock internal\n       5.3 small extra locks for top and bottom : lock grip - plate cut from the door (also add the door\n       now) - lock internal - lock spacer - lock locker\n    6. Add the hinges to the doors if needed (for two-panes front doors)\n    7. fasten the top\n    8. Attach two side panel inner plates to a side panel with the two pegs (use glue if necessary) and\n    repeat a second time\n    9. If you use a lock with key, add the last short peg to the back plate (you may want to sand it a bit\n    on the other half so that the key can be attached easily enough, but it should not fal off either)\n    10. You should now be able to close and open all the doors\n    Usage recommendations:\n    1. Add your paper sheets fron one side or the other (normally you leave either left or right closed,\n    depending on which is more comfortable for you)\n    2. Thick paper is easier to handle ; if you print on a home printer, use the thickest you printer can\n    print (probably around 200 grams per square meter) ; if you want extra quality, go to a printing shop\n    and ask them for 300 grams per square meter printing\n    3. You can also buy virgin drawing paper to write your own stories\n    4. If you decided to go for the lock with key, you can ask one of the participants to unlock the box,\n    it really helps in immersing into toe story\n    5. If you need a kamishibai for showing images during a guided tour, you may choose to use the\n    one-panel front, and use transparent acrylic for the back and front panels to keep you sheets\n    protected from light rain ; you may need to cut the box from a rain-resistant material\n    (outside-compatible plywood or acrylic)\n    ",

So we generate everything else to fit those measurements.\n\nSet `x` and `y` to the dimensions of the actual artwork.\n\n* If your photo has a border, measure inside it.\n* If your photo does not have a border, still measure the actual artwork. Don't reduce the dimensions to allow for mounting. We do that separately.\n\nA real pro measures the photo, calculates the matting, and cuts the glass to fit the matting.\nWe will assume that you are not in fact a real pro, and can't be trusted with a glass cutter.\nSo measure your glass and we'll calculate the matting to suit it. If you aren't using glass,\nwe'll calculate the matting size based on \""golden ratio of areas\"" like the pros do. Everyone\nwill think your frame is perfect, but they won't know why.\n\nMatting is just cardboard. Its jobs are to keep the glass off the photo, provide a clean border around the artwork,\nand make the whole thing look fancy. You can attach the photo to the matting or to the back of the frame.\nEither way, the matting conceals all sorts of sins like bad cuts, glue marks, or mounting with blue painter's tape.\nMatting also lets you reuse the frame for different sized photos. Just generate a new mat with the same glass dimensions.\n\nThe hole in the matting is smaller than the photo. This is so the photo doesn't fall out.\nEven if your photo has a border, the hole needs to be a bit smaller than the photo,\nor you will struggle to line up the photo without the edges showing.\nRecommended overlaps are given in the settings. Don't worry about \""losing\"" too much of the photo.\nThe matting will make the photo look bigger and more important. There's never anything\ninteresting in the last 2mm of a photo anyway.\n",

"## Tray/Box insert dividers.\nTray insert with extra margin for that perfect fit.\n\nYou can specify the grid sizes with the standard `(sx, sy)` format, which allows nice\nvariable rows and columns.  If you  check the `outside` box, the full outside of the\ntray insert ends up being the sum of all the sx/sy values.  However, if you want a\nconsistent cell size, and uncheck outside, then the overall dimensinos end up\nlarger by `(n-1)*thickenss`, to make space for your walls.\n\nYou can specify the `x` and `y` parameters if you like, just make them larger than\nwhat the sum of `(sx, sy)` would end up with, and the walls be automatically extended to\nto exactly fill the inside of your tray or box.\n\nSo, for example, if you're fitting `30mm x 40mm` items and want them to\nfit inside a `250mm x 300mm` box, you can specify\n\n    sx = 30*8\n    sy = 40*7\n    uncheck outside\n    x=250\n    y=300\n\nThis frees your mind into separately thinking about the cell size vs the overall box size.\n\n![Tray Extra](static/samples/TrayInsert-3.jpg)\n    ",
